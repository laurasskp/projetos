First, you'll need to install linux.
If you use Windows, it can be WSL.

After, you'll need to install GitHub CLI: 
https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md

You must have Git installed and configured
https://github.com/git-guides/install-git
And you must have an authentication key 

Then, last thing is to create a token on GitHub: settings > developer settings > personal access tokens and set the permission to access the repo and do things such as issues creation.
